## Realtime Photo-Mosaic Generator ##
Tessellate provides a fun, interactive way for event planners to engage guests and create amazing, lasting memorabilia.

### Summary ###
Make your next event the talk of the town! Integrate Tessellate and watch in awe as guests work together to produce a mosaic of memories in real time. Any guest with a smartphone can login with your event's code, take a picture and immediately see it added to the developing mosaic. Tap any individual picture to zoom in, view comments or add comments of your own. When the champagne is gone and the lights have died, you and your guests are left with a personal work of art and permanent collection of memories. 

### Problem ###
The quality of modern smartphone cameras has made it possible for anyone to take amazing pictures, but sharing these pictures effectively amongst large groups continues to remain a challenge. At many social gatherings, circles are mixed so guests are not already connected via social media, but everyone would enjoy access to the same collection of photos. Even when attendees are all good friends, the group must wait for everyone to get around to uploading their pictures. This process can take weeks and more often than not is left incomplete.

### Solution ###
Tessellate eliminates the pain and inconvenience associated with sharing event photos in a way that is decisively unique and interactive. Now your guests can view everyone's contributions in real time and connect through the shared experience of building something distinct and personal. Whether you are planning a wedding, party or networking event, Tessellate will add the perfect focal point and bring your guests together.

### How to Get Started ###
Setting up your first event couldn't be easier! Simply pick an event code, specify the date and time of your event, and upload an image of your choice that you want to turn into a mosaic.
